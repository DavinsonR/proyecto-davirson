# Design System: Davirson Novoa — Research Tear Sheet

## Overview

**Creative North Star: "The Research Tear Sheet"**

This is a document, not an interface. The reader is a hiring analyst who reads assets for a living: verdict at the top, figures in a ruled band, evidence below, disclosures at the foot. Everything the system does follows from that arrangement. Structure is carried by hairline rules and banded rows — the sheet's own grammar — and never by boxes floating over a ground. Light is the home state because the audience reads in a bright office and prints; dark is a real second theme re-stepped against its own ground (#0e1216), not an inversion of the light one.

The palette is a two-voice instrument on a paper ground. Institutional blue owns whole bands and every technical claim; amber marks human and purpose content only, and nothing else. Type is two faces, committed: Archivo for all UI and prose, Source Serif 4 reserved for figures set large and for the one verdict line. Figures are tabular everywhere, wired at the body so every column of numbers aligns without per-element work.

The build refuses, explicitly and by name, the dark developer-portfolio arrangement it replaced: mono type, neon accents, terminal chrome, and a terminal-styled navigation bar. It also refuses ornament that would make it feel like a product page — no cards, no shadows, no gradients, no glow.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Paper-white ground with near-black ink; dark theme re-stepped, never inverted
- Hairline rules and full-bleed tinted bands as the only structural devices
- Institutional blue for data and technical claims; amber for human/purpose content only
- Two faces: Archivo everywhere, Source Serif 4 for large figures and the verdict
- Tabular figures at the body level; every number aligns
- Zero shadows, zero cards, 3px radius on controls and nothing else
- One authored motion moment, disabled entirely under reduced-motion

## Colors

A paper-and-ink base with exactly two accent voices, each with a jurisdiction it never leaves.

### Primary
- **Institutional Blue** (`cold`, 8.1:1 on paper): The technical voice. It owns the figures band as a full-bleed tint (`coldsoft`) capped by a 2px rule, the primary action buttons, the verdict line, section labels that carry a data claim, the skill indicator segments, the chart series, the focus ring, and the selection highlight. When blue appears, the content is a measurement or a technical claim.
- **Blue Wash** (`coldsoft`) / **Blue Hairline** (`coldline`): The band tint and its internal column dividers. These are the blue's structural form, used when a whole region is technical rather than a single phrase.

### Secondary
- **Reserved Amber** (`warm`, 6.0:1 on paper): The human voice, and nothing else. Three places in the shipped build carry it: the availability block in the first viewport (2px top rule plus `warmsoft` ground), the hiring/contact section's 2px top rule, and the CV's career-transition passage label. Data and technical claims never wear amber.
- **Amber Wash** (`warmsoft`): The availability block's ground; the only tinted surface that isn't blue.

### Tertiary
- **Verdict Green** (`pos`, also `live`): Positive standing — remote-mode tags, the live pipeline dot, the pipeline status pill.
- **Verdict Red** (`neg`): Negative standing in figures. Present in the token set and reserved for it.
- **Caution Ochre** (`building`): The one status that is neither settled nor technical — work in progress.

### Neutral
- **Paper** (`paper`): The page ground, and the text color on filled buttons. In dark it is #0e1216, a cool near-black chosen against its own ramp.
- **Band** (`band`) / **Band Deep** (`band2`): Full-bleed neutral bands that separate a region without drawing a box; the disclosures section rides on `band`.
- **Rule** (`rule`) / **Soft Rule** (`rulesoft`): The 1px hairlines that carry all structure. `rule` divides content rows and outlines controls; `rulesoft` divides metadata from content and separates sections at lower contrast.
- **Ink** (`ink`, 15.8:1): Headings, figure values, and any phrase the reader must not miss. Also the fill of the secondary dark button.
- **Body** (`body`, 8.4:1): Running prose.
- **Muted** (`muted`, 5.4:1): Metadata — dates, periods, tracked-caps labels, chart axis text.

### Named Rules

**The Amber Reservation Rule.** Amber marks human and purpose content only: availability, hiring, the career-transition passage. Every data point, metric, and technical claim wears institutional blue or ink. This rule is binding, it predates the redesign, and getting it backwards was a live review finding — an amber number is a bug.

**The Two-Voice Rule.** A surface has exactly two accents. If a new state needs a color, it takes one of the four verdict/status hues (`pos`, `neg`, `live`, `building`) — it does not invent a third accent.

**The Re-Stepped Dark Rule.** The dark theme is authored against #0e1216 with its own ink ramp and its own accent steps (blue lightens to #74b0e4, amber to #d9a05b). Never derive dark by inverting or filtering the light values; each step is chosen for contrast on its own ground.

**The Band, Not the Box Rule.** A region is set apart by a full-bleed tint (`coldsoft`, `warmsoft`, `band`) capped with a 1–2px rule. It is never set apart by a bordered, rounded, floating container.

## Typography

**Display Font:** Archivo (with ui-sans-serif, system-ui, sans-serif)
**Body Font:** Archivo (same face; the system runs on one grotesque)
**Figure Font:** Source Serif 4 (with ui-serif, Georgia, serif)

**Character:** Archivo is the grotesque of American financial print — tight, high-contrast at weight, unglamorous. Source Serif 4 enters only where a printed sheet would set a number large, which makes every serif appearance read as a figure the reader is meant to weigh. Two faces, no third.

### Hierarchy
- **Display** (800, clamp 30–44px, 1.08, -0.03em): The name at the top of the sheet. Once per document.
- **Verdict** (Source Serif 4, 400, clamp 27–38px, 1.1, blue): What this asset is, stated once, large, in the serif. The single most important line in the build.
- **Figure** (Source Serif 4, 400, clamp 34–46px, 1.0, tabular): The four values in the figures band and any number set large. Ink at rest, blue on hover of its own proof link.
- **Headline** (700, clamp 23–31px, 1.15, -0.02em): Section titles.
- **Lede** (600, clamp 19–23px, 1.35, -0.015em, balanced): The thesis line under the name; one per surface.
- **Title** (600–700, 16.5–21px): Row and article headings inside a section.
- **Body** (400, 15–15.5px, 1.7, max 62–70ch): Running prose.
- **Body Small** (400, 14–14.5px, 1.55–1.65): Dense rows, capability details, the availability block, footer.
- **Label** (600, 12–12.5px, 0.08–0.09em, uppercase, muted or blue): Tracked-caps metadata — the classification line, field labels (`PROBLEM`, `BUILT`, `WHY IT MATTERS`), the figures band label, section eyebrow labels on the CV. Muted by default; blue when the field carries a technical claim.

### Named Rules

**The 14px Floor Rule.** No prose is set below 14px. This answered a real accessibility complaint. The 12–12.5px step exists only for tracked-caps metadata labels — never for a sentence a reader has to read.

**The Serif-Is-A-Figure Rule.** Source Serif 4 appears only on numbers set large and on the single verdict line. A serif paragraph, a serif heading, or a serif button does not exist in this system.

**The Tabular Everywhere Rule.** `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` with `"tnum" 1, "cv05" 1` is wired at the body. Numbers align in columns across the whole document by default; nothing opts out.

**The Label-Is-A-Field Rule.** Tracked caps label a field, a band, or the document itself (the classification line, which is native to the form). They do not sit above a headline as a decorative kicker.

## Layout

One centered column, `max-w-[1080px]` with `px-6` gutters on the home surface; the CV re-derives the same rhythm at `max-w-[980px]` and the project surface at the same measure. Sections are separated by `border-b border-rule` and breathe on `py-14` to `py-16` (56–64px); the CV uses `py-14` with `border-t border-rulesoft` for lower-contrast internal separation.

The document header is a two-column grid at `lg` (`minmax(0,1fr)_300px`): the verdict column and the availability block, which sits `self-start` so it aligns to the top of the ink rather than stretching. Below it, the figures band runs full-bleed at the viewport while its contents stay in the 1080px measure — the band is the only element allowed to break the column.

Figures are a 2-up grid on mobile, 4-up at `lg`, divided by `border-l border-coldline` with the first column's border and padding suppressed. Content grids elsewhere are 2-up (`sm`) to 3-up (`lg`) for capabilities and a 1.35:1 split for track record versus the skill scale.

Measures are capped in `ch`, not px: 40ch for the lede, 62–70ch for prose, 58ch for dense disclosure text, 46ch for sidebar notes, 24ch for the closing headline. Vertical rhythm runs on a 4px base with the working steps at 8/12/20/28/44/64px.

The navigation is `sticky top-0 z-50` at 61px with a 95%-opacity paper ground and a light backdrop blur, capped by a hairline. A `no-print` class removes the nav and theme control from print, and print forces pure white ground with black text — the sheet is expected to be printed.

## Elevation & Depth

**This system has no shadows.** Not one `box-shadow` ships in the build. Depth is entirely tonal and linear: a hairline rule, a heavier 2px rule to open a band, and a tinted ground to mark a region's jurisdiction. The three-level vocabulary is: page ground (`paper`), banded region (`band`, `coldsoft`, `warmsoft`), and rule (`rulesoft` → `rule` → 2px `ink`/`cold`/`warm`). Weight of rule signals importance of boundary; nothing lifts.

The only surface effect anywhere is the navbar's translucent ground with `backdrop-blur-sm`, which exists so text passing under the bar doesn't collide with the nav text — not to suggest a floating plane.

### Named Rules

**The Flat Sheet Rule.** No shadow, no glow, no gradient, no elevation of any kind. If a region needs to separate, it takes a rule or a band. A drop shadow anywhere in this system is a defect.

**The Rule-Weight Rule.** 1px `rulesoft` divides metadata; 1px `rule` divides content rows; 2px in `ink`, `cold`, or `warm` opens a major band and declares its voice.

## Shapes

The form language is rectangular. Bands, rows, blocks, and the availability aside all have square corners (0 radius) — a tear sheet does not round its columns. Radius exists only on interactive controls at **3px**, just enough to read as pressable, plus 2px on the focus ring and full-round on two elements whose meaning is roundness: the status pill and the live-pipeline dot. The skill-scale segments carry a 1px radius so ten adjacent bars don't read as one solid rail.

Borders are 1px by default and 2px when opening a band. Underlines are structural too: figure labels carry a 1.5px blue underline at 4px offset that thickens to 2.5px on hover, and links in the availability block underline in amber at 50% opacity.

Icons are inline SVG drawn at a single 1.3px stroke weight on a 16px box. No icon font, no emoji, no third-party icon package.

## Components

### Buttons
- **Shape:** Barely-rounded rectangle (3px), no shadow, no transform on hover.
- **Primary:** Institutional blue ground, paper text, 600 weight, `px-5 py-3` at 14.5px (`px-4 py-2.5` at 14px in dense contexts). Hover fades to 90% opacity.
- **Ink:** Same geometry filled with `ink` — used for the secondary strong action on a surface that already spent its blue (the live-demo link).
- **Outline:** Paper ground, `rule` hairline border, ink text. Hover moves both border and text to blue. This is the download/secondary pair to every primary.
- **Text link:** Blue, 500–600 weight, underline on hover; the closing section's social links are this.
- **Focus:** Global — 2px blue outline at 2px offset with a 2px radius. Never removed, never restyled per component.

### Chips
- **Style:** `rule` hairline border, transparent or `band` ground, body text at 12.5–13px, 3px radius, `px-2.5 py-1`. Used for stack tags. No fill, no accent — a stack tag is not a claim.
- **Status Pill:** Fully rounded, 11px tracked caps, tinted from its own status hue (10% ground, 35% border, full-strength text) so it stays legible on paper and on the dark ground alike.

### Cards / Containers
**There are no cards.** Cards were removed from all three surfaces during review. A grouping is expressed as: a top rule of the appropriate weight and color, optional tinted ground, and internal padding of `px-5 py-4`/`py-5`. The availability block and the "why it matters" callout are the canonical examples — both are open blocks, not enclosed boxes.

### Navigation
Sticky hairline-capped bar on a 95% paper ground. Wordmark in Archivo 600 at 15px in ink; links at 14px 500 in body, hovering to blue; no underline, no active-state pill. The right cluster is three controls at 36px height: a **labelled** language switch (blue-on-blue-wash with a `coldline` border — labelled because a dim glyph in the previous build went unfound by reviewers), an outlined icon-only theme toggle, and a blue contact button that hides below `sm`. Mobile drops the center links entirely rather than collapsing them into a menu.

### Figures Band
The signature component. A full-bleed `coldsoft` region opened by a 2px blue rule, carrying a tracked-caps blue label, a live pipeline stamp on the same baseline, a note line, and a 2-up/4-up row of figures divided by `coldline` verticals. Each figure is a serif value over an ink label with a blue underline, and each is a link to its own proof; hovering moves the value to blue and thickens the underline. The band is where the reader verifies the verdict.

### Pipeline Stamp
A 2px green dot (two stacked round spans, the lower at 60% opacity) followed by 13px muted text carrying the pipeline's own published timestamp. It falls back to static wording when the fetch fails and never to a fabricated date.

### Skill Scale
Ten flat 6px segments at 3px gaps, filled in blue up to the level and `rule` beyond, under a right-aligned serif figure with a muted `/10`. It is a numbered indicator, not a decorative bar chart — the number leads, the segments confirm.

### Charts
Line only, on paper ground: series in blue at 2px solid, benchmark in muted at 2px dashed (`5 6`), gridlines in `rule` at 1px. Series are distinguished by dash pattern and end-point label as well as hue, so the chart survives grayscale printing and color-vision deficiency. All chart text wears text tokens (`ink`, `body`, `muted`), never the series color.

### Motion
One authored moment: `.settle`, a 620ms `cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)` exponential ease-out from opacity 0 / 10px down / 3px blur, staggered in reading order across the document header only (60ms → 340ms + 70ms per figure). It runs from an already-visible default so nothing depends on JS to be readable, and it is disabled outright under `prefers-reduced-motion` along with all transitions and smooth scroll. Everything else that moves is a color or opacity transition on hover.

### Theming
Theme follows system preference by default, with a manual toggle persisted in `localStorage` and applied pre-paint by an inline script so a reload never flashes the wrong ground. Browser surfaces wear the palette too: selection is blue-on-paper, scrollbars are thin `rule`-on-transparent with a paper-bordered thumb, and `color-scheme: light dark` is declared.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do:
- **Do** carry structure with hairline rules (1px `rule`/`rulesoft`) and full-bleed bands, and open a major band with a 2px rule in `ink`, `cold`, or `warm`.
- **Do** reserve amber for human and purpose content — availability, hiring, the career-transition passage — and give every data point and technical claim to institutional blue or ink.
- **Do** set every large figure in Source Serif 4, tabular, with its label and a note underneath.
- **Do** keep prose at 14px or larger; use the 12–12.5px tracked-caps step only for metadata labels.
- **Do** author the dark theme against its own ground (#0e1216) with re-chosen steps, and keep light as the default reading state.
- **Do** link every figure to the artifact that proves it.
- **Do** state a claim once, large, and let the band below verify it.
- **Do** keep motion to the single `.settle` stagger on a document header and disable it fully under reduced-motion.

### Don't:
- **Don't** add a shadow, glow, or gradient. The system is flat; a `box-shadow` here is a defect.
- **Don't** wrap content in a card. Removing cards was a review decision on all three surfaces; use a top rule plus optional tint instead.
- **Don't** put amber on a number, a metric, a stack tag, or any technical claim.
- **Don't** introduce a third accent hue; extend with the existing verdict/status tokens.
- **Don't** ship mono type, neon accents, terminal chrome, or a terminal-styled navigation bar — this world was chosen specifically against them.
- **Don't** set a paragraph, heading, or button in the serif; the serif means "this is a figure."
- **Don't** derive the dark theme by inverting or filtering light values.
- **Don't** hide a control behind a bare dim glyph where a short label would work — the language switch is labelled for exactly this reason.
- **Don't** round a band, row, or block; radius belongs to controls (3px) and to the two elements whose meaning is round.
- **Don't** use an icon font, emoji, or a third-party icon package; icons are inline SVG at a 1.3px stroke on a 16px box.
