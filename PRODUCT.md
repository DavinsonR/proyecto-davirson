## Users

**Primary: hiring managers and recruiters for finance-adjacent data roles**, at remote-friendly companies in the US, Canada and Latin America. They arrive from a LinkedIn profile, an application, or a direct email, usually on a desktop in an office, and they scan for 30–60 seconds before deciding whether to open the CV. Many are non-technical HR screeners who need to classify the candidate fast; a smaller group are finance or analytics leads who will judge the actual work.

**Secondary: peers in the same transition** (finance/economics people moving toward data), who arrive through shared links and treat the site as a reference for how to do it.

Their job: decide in under a minute whether this person fits an open role, and at what level.

## Product Purpose

A personal site that converts a scan into an interview for **Finance Data Analyst** roles — positions at the intersection of financial analysis and data engineering — without the salary cut that a "career changer" framing invites.

Success is not traffic. Success is: the visitor understands the crossover in seconds, believes it (the work is verifiable), downloads the CV or writes.

## Positioning

**The crossover already exists and is demonstrable.** Davirson is an economist and FP&A consultant (Neoris/EPAM, operations across 15+ countries) who built and operates a production data platform on his own: daily ingestion of 48 assets, a PostgreSQL medallion warehouse with dbt, automated data-quality tests, CI/CD, and a Power BI semantic model.

A neighboring candidate cannot truthfully copy this claim: finance people rarely ship pipelines, and data engineers rarely read a P&L. The site's job is to make that pairing legible and priced accordingly — a scarce specialist, not a beginner in a new field.

## Operating Context

- Shared as a link from LinkedIn, job applications and email; frequently opened in a bright office, sometimes screen-shared or printed.
- Read in English by most decision-makers; Spanish matters for Latin American employers and for the peer audience.
- The CV PDF is the artifact that survives the visit — it gets forwarded internally.
- Judged next to conventional CVs and templated portfolios.

## Capabilities and Constraints

- Next.js 16 + Tailwind v4 + TypeScript, fully static (SSG), deployed on Vercel. Zero backend, zero database, $0 hosting.
- Bilingual ES/EN through `/[lang]/` routes and `lib/dictionaries.ts` as the single source of truth for every string; the CV PDFs are generated from that same file.
- A live project page (`/projects/trading-sim`) reads JSON published by the `market-data-medallion` repository, refreshed daily by a GitHub Actions cron. The site stays static.
- Open decision: the CV PDF may be regenerated in LaTeX/Overleaf for a more conventional format (peer feedback), replacing the current script-generated version.

## Brand Commitments

- Name shown publicly: **Davirson Novoa Ramírez** (Davirson on legal documents; online accounts use "Davinson" — both are correct in their own place).
- **The amber rule**: the warm accent (`#D9A05B`) is reserved for human/purpose content. Technical content uses the cold accent. This separation is binding and predates this redesign.
- **Build in public, honestly**: status and progress indicators must reflect reality, including unfinished work. No heroic filter.
- Voice: direct, specific, no marketing inflation. Claims are backed by artifacts.
- Rejected in an earlier round and still rejected: a terminal-styled navigation bar.

## Evidence on Hand

Real, verifiable — none of this may be fabricated or inflated:

- **market-data-medallion** (github.com/DavinsonR/market-data-medallion): 48 assets, ~55k daily candles, 1,347 strategy variants with out-of-sample validation, 161 unit tests, 100 dbt data-quality checks, daily automated refresh, Power BI semantic model. Public repo.
- Findings from that project: only 11.5% of in-sample winning strategies survived out-of-sample; requiring five confirming signals produced zero trades; Ecopetrol's +96.9% USD return decomposed into +53.6% company and +43.4pp currency.
- FP&A consultant at Neoris/EPAM with operations across 15+ countries.
- Winner, BodyTech Trends data analytics hackathon (2024).
- Ecopetrol scholar — Mario Galán Gómez merit program (2018).
- Stanford Machine Learning Specialization (Coursera, 2024).
- M.Sc. Economics in progress, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana (2025–2026); B.Sc. Economics (2020–2024).
- Languages: native Spanish, English B2, Portuguese A2. GMT-5, full overlap with US hours.
- **No photograph available yet** — the hero must work without one and accept one later without a redesign.
- No testimonials, no client references, no employer logos cleared for use.

## Product Principles

1. **Price the crossover, don't apologize for the transition.** Every claim frames finance + data as one existing capability, never as a work in progress toward data.
2. **A project is a problem solved, not a technique demonstrated.** Lead with the question answered and who would care; the stack is supporting evidence.
3. **Decide in one minute.** Anything that does not help a scanning recruiter classify and act belongs on a secondary page or nowhere.
4. **Verifiable over impressive.** Every number links to the artifact that proves it.
5. **Legible before beautiful.** Contrast, type size and hierarchy are functional requirements — the audience reads in bright rooms and is often over 40.

## Accessibility & Inclusion

- Body text must meet WCAG AA contrast in both themes; the previous dark-only build failed this for a non-technical reader (real feedback: "some letters are super small and you can barely see them with that color").
- Minimum 14px for any prose a visitor is expected to read; 11–12px reserved for true metadata labels with sufficient contrast.
- Light and dark themes both first-class, following the visitor's system preference with a visible manual toggle.
- The language switcher must be obvious — the previous placement was invisible against the dark background.

## Validation on Hand

Structured feedback from four real reviewers (August 2026), scored 1–10:

| Reviewer | Profile | Visual | Ease | Clarity | Trust | Overall |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Simón | Engineer → data, M.Sc. Data Analytics | **5** | 8 | 8 | 8 | 7 |
| Nicol (15) | Non-technical, outside fresh eyes | 8 | — | 7 | **10** | 9 |
| Mateo | Economist, same transition path | 7 | 10 | 7 | **10** | 8 |
| Felix | Data engineer, extensive HR screening experience | qualitative | qualitative | qualitative | qualitative | qualitative |

The pattern: **content earns trust (8–10), design does not carry it (5–7).**

Recurring, independent complaints: too dark · too much content, "you get lost" · projects don't show the problem they solved, "it disconnects from the value it can bring to a person or a company" · text too small and low-contrast · language switcher invisible · should be English-first · CV page too long, leave the PDF download · add a photo · add personality (books, philosophy).
